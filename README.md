Team 1: *Paulo*, *Janko Radakovic*, *Carlos Delgado*, *Kayla Woodbury*

## Code overview
This software is a digital mailbox system using Ruby on Rails to allow users to create accounts and send/receive messages.The goal of this challenge was to review previous made code and create tests for the code to ensure the following user stories are met:

* As a user, in order to create a new account, I would like to receive a confirmation or error message that account was/n't created.

* As a user, in order log into my account, I would like the log in button to access my mail after login.

* As a user, in order to read my mail, I would like to see my inbox of all received mail

* As a user, in order to communicate with people, I would like to be able to compose, send and see sent mail

* As a user, in order to maintain a organised inbox, I would like to be able to delete mail

* As a user, in order to leave the mailbox, I would like to be able to log out of the system

A big part of your work will be to cover the application with tests."
