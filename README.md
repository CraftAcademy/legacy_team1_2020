# Mailbox: Legacy Code Challenge
Team 1: *Paulo*, *Janko Radakovic*, *Carlos Delgado*, *Kayla Woodbury*

## Code overview
This software is a digital mailbox system using Ruby on Rails to allow users to create accounts and send/receive messages.The goal of this challenge was to review previous made code and create tests for the code to ensure the following user stories are met:

* As a user, in order to create a new account, I would like to receive a confirmation or error message that account was/n't created.

* As a user, in order log into my account, I would like the log in button to access my mail after login.

* As a user, in order to read my mail, I would like to see my inbox of all received mail

* As a user, in order to communicate with people, I would like to be able to compose, send and see sent mail

* As a user, in order to maintain a organised inbox, I would like to be able to delete mail

* As a user, in order to leave the mailbox, I would like to be able to log out of the system



#### Prompt these User Stories are responding to:
"You are assigned by your Project Manager to work on an application that is undocumented and not actively maintained.You and your team's task is to test the code base, deploy it to a staging server and get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible.This also means that you will need to find any bugs and broken functionality and fix those. A big part of your work will be to cover the application with tests."
